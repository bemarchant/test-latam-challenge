2. Generate the following additional columns. Please export them to a CSV file named synthetic_features.csv:
- high_season : 1 if Date-I is between Dec-15 and Mar-3, or Jul-15 and Jul-31, or Sep-11 and Sep-30, 0 otherwise.
- min_diff : difference in minutes between Date-O and Date-I.
- delay_15 : 1 if min_diff > 15, 0 if not.
- period_day : morning (between 5:00 and 11:59), afternoon (between 12:00 and 18:59) and night (between 19:00 and 4:59), based onDate-I .

3. 
What is the behavior of the delay rate across 
- destination       ['Des-I']
- airline           ['Emp-I']
- month of the year ['MES']
- day of the week   ['DIANOM']
- season            ['high_season']
- type of flight    ['TIPOVUELO']

What variables would you expect to have the most influence in predicting delays?
